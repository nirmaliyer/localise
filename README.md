# Localisation code based on NN

This code implements [Himangshu's Neural network library](https://github.com/hsaikia/NeuralNetwork) to 
localise SPHiNX GRBs. 

The setup is not optimal and although a local version of the original HS (taken in `Feb 2018`) is available, 
any change in the original library must be synced for best results.
